# Web Visualization with Plotly, Flask and Ajax - FlaPjax

Why use Dash when Plotly plus Flask is easy and more flexible? Add a little bit of AJAX and you can add interactivity.

This repo contains the code for the articles listed, below.

## [Web Visualization with Plotly and Flask](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-visualization-with-plotly-and-flask-3660abf9c946)

This article explores using Flask and Plotly as an alternative to using Dash when creating Web apps. It compares a simple Dash app with a Flask/Plotly one and finds that the latter is easy and more flexible than it's Dash counterpart. You can find the code for the article in the [Plotly](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly/tree/main/plotly) folder.

## [An Interactive Web Dashboard with Plotly and Flask](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-interactive-web-dashboard-with-plotly-and-flask-c365cdec5e3f)

This article shows how to create a truly interactive app as you might with Dash with callbacks but using Plotly and Flask and a bit of AJAX. The code for this is in 
[plotlycallback-gm](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly/tree/main/plotlycallback-gm).

A slightly modified version of the code above can be found here:
[plotlycallback-gm2](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly/tree/main/plotlycallback-gm2). In this version no parameters are passed to the template and the chart is always loaded using Ajax. It also has the benefit of labelling the chart!

This is the first stage in a development of **FlaPjax** a virtual framework for creating data visualizations with **Fla**sk, **P**lotly and A**jax**.
