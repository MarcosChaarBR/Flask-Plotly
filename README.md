# Web Visualization with Plotly, Flask and Ajax - FlaPjax

Why use Dash when Plotly plus Flask is easy and more flexible? Add a little bit of AJAX and you can add interactivity.

The code in the [Plotly](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly/tree/main/plotly) folder supports the Medium article [Web Visualization with Plotly and Flask](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-visualization-with-plotly-and-flask-3660abf9c946) that explores an alternative to using Dash when creating Web apps with Plotly

[plotlycallback-gm](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly/tree/main/plotlycallback-gm) contains the code for the article [An Interactive Web Dashboard with Plotly and Flask](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-interactive-web-dashboard-with-plotly-and-flask-c365cdec5e3f) which shows how to create a truly interactive app as you might with Dash with callbacks but using Plotly and Flask and a bit of AJAX.

This is the first stage in a development of **FlaPjax** a virtual framework for creating data visualizations with **Fla**sk, **P**lotly and A**jax**.
