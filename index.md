# Web Visualization

Why use Dash when Plotly plus Flask is easy and more flexible?

I wrote a Medium article [Web Visualization with Plotly and Flask](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-visualization-with-plotly-and-flask-3660abf9c946) that explores an alternative to using Dash when creating Web apps with Plotly, Youan find the example code here: [Plotly](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly/tree/main/plotly)

To get all the code for this project either clone this [repo](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly) or [download the zip file](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
